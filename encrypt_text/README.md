# Encrypt Text

Given a text, encrypt it by shifting each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

> Original alphabet:      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<br>
Alphabet rotated +3:    defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc

Example

s = `There's-a-starman-waiting-in-the-sky`
k = 3

The alphabet is rotated by 3, matching the mapping above. The encrypted string is `Wkhuh'v-d-vwdupdq-zdlwlqj-lq-wkh-vnb`.
